      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: We stash away the surplus items that the wealthy people around here
          consider unnecessary. We eat everything we can and sell the rest. But we
          got carried away and made a big mistake.

      - npcName: 
        text: We sent 5 Oopsies to steal... uh... borrow the heart stone, but there
          were earthquakes and storms, and all five of them turned into stone. We
          put one of them at the entrance here as decoration, and the other four
          remained there. Since that day, we haven't taken anything.

    - question: Did you take the lizard's keys?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: If something is missing, we probably stole... uh... took it. But as
          I said, everyone is now afraid to go to the stash, and we don't know how
          to get there because the ladder was destroyed in the earthquake.

      - npcName: 
        text: But we think that maybe if we take the heart stone back and ask the
          gods for mercy, everything might return to normal. However, none of us
          are willing to do it. If this continues, we'll lose not only our stash
          but also our lives.

    - question: What do I need to do?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: If you want to take the key and help us, we are hiding the heart stone
          in the glass container behind me. You can take it and put it back in its
          place. Maybe the gods will forgive everyone, and we can continue to steal...
          uh... borrow things.

      - npcName: 
        text: You can use the boat below when you leave. We don't go that way anymore.
          At least it will be useful to you. We stole... uh... took it from a sailor's
          son. I mean, he gave it to us willingly, of course.
