        text: My lover is a very beautiful golem. Its stones are extremely shiny
          and hard. A true golem classic. However, I haven't seen it for a long time
          because it needs to prove itself, and I promised to wait here.

          and I can't go anywhere until my lover solves the puzzle and proves himself.
          So I'm sorry, but you can't pass through here.

          island on the left. If you follow that bridge, you can reach my lover.
          Tell her that I've been waiting for her and that I love her very much.
