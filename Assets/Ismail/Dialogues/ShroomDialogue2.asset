    - question: Are you a farmer?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Yes. I've been farming since I was a child, and I love it, but my main
          special interest is flowers. I grow fragrant flowers and beautify nature.
          We also bring happiness to the other people in the village.

      - npcName: 
        text: But growing flowers has become very difficult now. The swamp is advancing
          towards our village every day, and I can't plant enough flowers to stop
          it. Finding seeds has also become very hard.

    - question: Why is the swamp advancing?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Because a wicked, terrible witch came and started using the essences
          of all the plants to make spells and potions for herself. But instead of
          the flowers she takes, she plants bad wild plants. Also, the fumes from
          the boiling potions in her cauldron smell so awful that no one can go near
          there. This place has become uninhabitable.

      - npcName: 
        text: For now, I need to plant these to be able to fight back. Will you help
          me plant them?

    - question: How can I plant the flowers?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Planting the flowers is very simple, but growing them requires some
          effort. Can you plant the last three flowers from those pots over there
          in the field below? First, gently remove them from the pots and then go
          place them in suitable spots.
