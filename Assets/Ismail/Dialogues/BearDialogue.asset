      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: We have a big problem. Everyone has to run and hide because if we don't,
          they catch us and take us to a metal place, and no one who goes there ever
          comes back.

    - question: What is the problem?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Actually, there are two problems. The first is a metal thing approaching
          here that captured all of us, and very few of us are left. Our future is
          in danger, and everyone is aware of this issue.

      - npcName: 
        text: The second one, which I think is a bigger problem, is that no one is
          trying to do anything. Everyone is scared and prefers to hide. Every week,
          I hold a council and try to convince them, but I haven't been able to convince
          anyone. If this continues, we will all be gone.

    - question: Can I join the council?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Of course. Maybe if you join and share your ideas, we can convince
          them to do something about it.

      - npcName: 
        text: The council will start soon in front of the penguins' house. If we
          hurry, we might make it in time. Remember, the penguins' house is the one
          with black walls and a white door.
