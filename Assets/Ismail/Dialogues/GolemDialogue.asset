    - question: Why are you competing with the cicadas?
      answers:
      - text: According to an ancient book, there is a rivalry between cicadas and
          ants. Every year, under the name of the Competition Festival, we ants hold
          a contest and, in the end, have a feast where we eat the food we have collected
          during the process.

    - question: Why aren't you working?
      answers:
      - text: I really want to work, but I lost the batteries for my antennas in
          a storm that just passed through, so I can't work right now.
        audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: da287befa4ba7354487419610a404fac, type: 3}
      - text: For an ant to navigate and function properly, its antennas are crucial.
          I'm afraid to even move because my antennas' batteries are dead, and I
          don't want to get lost. I can't even send signals to my friends. I'm stuck
          here.

    - question: Can I help you?
      answers:
      - text: I would be very happy! The batteries for my antennas are round and
          very thin. I think they might have been buried in the sand during the sandstorm,
          but I'm afraid to even search for them.
        audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: da287befa4ba7354487419610a404fac, type: 3}
      - text: If you want to help me, you can bring two batteries. I'll get my antennas
          working again and can go back to work with my friends. If you like, I can
          also give you one of my own tools. Maybe you need something sharp.
