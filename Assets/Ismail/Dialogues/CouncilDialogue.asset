      text: Friends, the ship is taking a few of our animals every day and no one
        comes back. We need to do something about this. What are your thoughts?

    - npcName: Orca
      text: This situation is becoming unbearable. We lose someone every day and
        we feel helpless.
      audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    - npcName: Fox
      text: Yes, this can't go on. But how can we stop the ship? Humans are very
        powerful and well-equipped.

    - npcName: Fox
      text: ' I think the first step should be to observe the ship secretly. We can
        find their weak points and develop a strategy.'
      audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    - npcName: Pinguin
      text: Yes, we need to understand them better. We should know their strengths
        and weaknesses to act accordingly.

    - npcName: Bear
      text: The idea of taking control of the ship makes sense, but it's located
        in a very cold area. Going there is a huge risk for everyone. How do we handle
        this?
      audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    - npcName: Orca
      text: Yes, we can't survive long in the cold. There has to be a way, but how?

        be tough.

    - npcName: Pinguin
      text: The cold is very dangerous. Even if we get there, we might not be able
        to function.

    - npcName: Deer
      text: We need something to protect us from the cold. Otherwise, no one can
        go there.

      text: Anna, what do you think? Do you have any ideas?
      audioClip: {fileID: 0}
    - npcName: Anna
      text: Actually, I don't feel the cold. Because I don't have feelings, I have
        an advantage in this situation. I can go to the ship and operate it. But
        I don't know..
