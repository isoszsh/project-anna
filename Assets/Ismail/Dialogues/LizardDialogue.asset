      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: I am the last living member of the lizard family. My family has been
          farming here for centuries, and like them, I continue the profession. However,
          I haven't been able to enter my home for a long time. That's why everyone
          calls me the homeless lizard.

    - question: Why can't you enter your house?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Come closer! I'll tell you a secret. There are tiny but very dangerous
          creatures living here, we call them Arachnis. They call themselves Oopsies.
          A few weeks ago, the Oopsies stole the key to my house.

      - npcName: 
        text: There must be a hideout around here somewhere. I've heard they stash
          everything they steal in a high place, but no one has ever seen or been
          there before. If you can talk to them and help me get my house key back,
          I'm sure there will be something useful for you in my house.

    - question: What do you know about butterflies?
      answers:
      - npcName: 
        text: Butterflies are beautiful creatures. Contrary to popular belief, they
          can live for quite a long time here, but I suppose you're not asking about
          that.

      - npcName: 
        text: According to an old legend, butterflies, due to their heightened senses,
          may be trying to help you find something you deeply desire, but of course,
          I don't know if those butterflies still exist or if they are searching
          for something in my house.
