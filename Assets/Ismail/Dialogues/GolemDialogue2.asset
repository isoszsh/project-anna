    - question: Why are you complaining about colors?
      answers:
      - text: Every golem has to prove themselves after reaching a certain age. I
          need to prove myself by solving this ancient puzzle, but it involves colors,
          and I'm colorblind.

    - question: Which ancient puzzle?
      answers:
      - text: There is an ancient puzzle just a little further from here. It represents
          the world and space, but I think it requires doing something with colors.
          Since I can't distinguish colors, I didn't understand anything.

      - text: If I solve the puzzle, I will be able to start a family and live happily
          with the one I love. He spends every day napping on the bridge while waiting
          for me.
        audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: da287befa4ba7354487419610a404fac, type: 3}
    - question: Can I take a look at the puzzle too?
      answers:
      - text: Of course, you can take a look. Don't forget to grab the brush on the
          table before you go.
        audioClip: {fileID: 8300000, guid: da287befa4ba7354487419610a404fac, type: 3}
      - text: If you manage to solve it, could you tell everyone that I solved it
          instead of you? That way, I can pass the test and move on with my life.
