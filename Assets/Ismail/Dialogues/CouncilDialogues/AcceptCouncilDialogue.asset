    - npcName: Fox
      text: What if we build a raft? It could get Anna close enough to the ship.

    - npcName: Orca
      text: Wait, what if we use ice? I can break off a large ice floe and push it.
        It could carry Anna to the ship. I can push the ice to where the water isn't
        too cold yet, and the momentum will carry Anna the rest of the way to the
        ship.

      text: That's a brilliant idea! Ice will float, and Orca can guide it swiftly
        through the water.

      text: Yes, and ice is sturdy enough for a short journey. We just need to make
        sure Anna is secure.

        to support Anna.
